# hikr Tutorial
Pronounced "hiker" (/ˈhaɪkə(r)/), hikr is a basic hike-tracking app.

## Forked for Educational Purposes
Using the original hikr app as basis for my own tutorial.  For homework, I added the following assignments.
1. Add swipe gesture for a hike is selected for a delete action
2. Add delete action business logic to the swipe gesture
3. Create a new hike page to add a new hike

## basic info
hikr is an example app case to accompany Fuse's [end-to-end Fuse app tutorial](https://www.fusetools.com/docs/tutorial/tutorial).

_Note: there have been some force-pushes on this repo, so if you've cloned it before the series went live, it's probably a good idea to delete it and clone again._
